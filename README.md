"👋 Hey there! I'm Manish Patla,

💡 Final-year B.Tech undergraduate in ECE with a keen interest in the fascinating domains of VLSI and Embedded Systems. Currently, I 
 am working on a research-based project in the domain of quantum computation, specifically focusing on implementing quantum error correction for 
 quantum circuits using Qiskit. 🌟

🧰  I’m currently learning Embedded Systems, STA, UVM and basic Protocol Knowledge on : UART,CAN,I2C,SPI with good Knowledge on Verilog, System Verilog,Digital Electronics..

🧪 By implementing various quantum error correction codes and techniques, I aim to mitigate noise and errors in quantum systems. This involves designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits, developing error detection and correction algorithms, and optimizing their implementation for real-world quantum computers.

🚀 On my GitHub, you'll find an assortment of projects and contributions showcasing my passion for VLSI, Embedded Systems, and quantum computation. I invite you to explore my repositories, where you'll discover innovative designs, code snippets, and verification methodologies, as well as my research on quantum error correction using Qiskit.

🌐 As I continue my journey in the world of hardware engineering and quantum computation, I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals, contributing to exciting projects, and exploring new opportunities.

📫 Let's connect and embark on this transformative journey together. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn – let's make a difference in the world of VLSI, Embedded Systems, and quantum computation! 🌍"
